    <h1>Cochlear Implant</h1>
    <p>I was planning to get an implant in April, but the COVID-19 virus prevented that.</p>
    <p>I will update this page when I have gotten it. Right now, all I can talk about is why I want one. I grew up oral and didn’t learn ASL until I was 17. It was a very long process of learning and I am now very fluent, but I still find myself wanting to talk and express myself with voice in English. Part of it is that I spent years learning how to talk and I don’t feel like I can give it up or otherwise it’s a waste of learning.</p>
