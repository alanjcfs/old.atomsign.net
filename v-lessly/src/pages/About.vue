    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      I am a long-term investor (or I strive to be) by investing in the total
      stock market fund. You can find out how I am saving half of my income
      every year and investing in a combination of total US stock market and
      total international stock market. Although I think that the US stock
      market will outperform the international stock market, investing
      internationally provides diversification and is a noncorrelated asset. It
      is also a potential inflation hedge as the US dollar fluctuates.
