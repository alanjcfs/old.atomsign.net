# Hello 2020

What a year it has been. I'm still shocked.

When I began 2020, what was on my mind the most was that it was going to be a
year of change. I was going to get a cochlear implant and this had the
potential to change my life. I was scared. I had just started a new job. My
biggest concern was not about a virus, but about surgery, whether I was going
to benefit from a new device that works differently from a hearing aid.

I told my audiologist about why I was finding it so difficult to decide, “There is just no impetus for me to make change.”

Unlike a few friends I had whose deafness progressively improved, my deafness
stayed the same. I did not gain anything I wanted to take away.

After the surgery on my right ear, I became more deaf on that ear, but in
exchange, I now can electrically stimulate the cochlea and I am getting much
more information from it than I ever had.

The only problem is, I need to make sense of it. With the hearing aid, I
could hear vowels, but not consonants. This made it particularly difficult to
associate sound with words. With the CI, I am starting to hear consonants
like s, th, sh, f. Hearing those sounds next to other sounds I'm more
familiar with (even though they do still sound different) meant that it is
like learning a new language.

The funny thing is that hearing people are probably used to it when they hear
a language they don't know. They hear the sounds they're familiar with, the
vowels and the consonants, and yet, these sounds are all placed in a strange
order that produce no meanings to them.

When I think about it now, it is pretty funny. For me, all I am hearing
sounds like gibberish to me.
