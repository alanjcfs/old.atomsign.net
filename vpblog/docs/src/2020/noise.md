# The Nature of Noise

As I am getting used to the implant, I have been fascinated knowing
that my implant is constantly stimulating electrically rather than
acoustically. It is amazing that biology has somehow permitted this
to be an alternative to some more difficult means of stimulation.

I grant that were this not available, there would be a bigger Deaf
population and I would have been on a different path.
