<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alan Fung-Schwarz. It took a long time before I was willing to call myself a geek.
Now, I'm calling myself a geek and a nerd and proud of it.</p>

<p>Why was I so reticent about it? The usual reasons: Geeks and nerds seemed to be uncool. I was
even unwilling to say that I like science fiction, that one of the TV shows I watched growing up
was Star Trek: The Next Generation.
